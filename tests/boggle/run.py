"""Boggle's signature systems, asserted against the real engine.

    python tests/boggle/run.py

Needs the dev server on :8777 (python tools/devserver.py 8777).

This suite exists because `tests/cards/run.py` proves only that a card resolves
without throwing, and CONTRACTS trap 12 is explicit that this proves nothing —
four dead cards passed exactly that check. Everything here asserts an EFFECT:
the enemy really became Unaware, the Search really replaced the Attack, the
Scare really spent the Fright.
